8. Introduction to your project. (Please include a clear overview of what your project is and why this is something that you want to work on.)
I’m Emil Yashayev, CEO of Pictographs, a gamified Photo&Earn platform built on blockchain under Picto Labs PTE. LTD. Pictographs empowers users to monetize their creativity through photo quests, blending photography with Web3 rewards like NFTs and tokens. With 60,000+ users, 1.2M+ NFTs minted, and a sold-out 7K NFT collection, we’re bridging creativity and technology to foster a thriving ecosystem. I’m passionate about this project because it merges my love for innovation with a mission to make blockchain accessible, rewarding, and fun—unlocking new opportunities for creators worldwide.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
At Pictographs, we’re tackling the problem of limited monetization opportunities for casual creators, especially photographers, while addressing the complexity and inaccessibility of blockchain for everyday users. Traditional platforms often undervalue creative output, and Web3 can feel intimidating to newcomers. This matters because billions of people take photos daily with smartphones, yet few can earn from it, and blockchain adoption lags without relatable use cases. By creating a simple, gamified Photo&Earn model, we empower users to profit from their creativity and onboard them into Web3—unlocking economic potential and driving mass adoption. It’s a win for creators and the blockchain ecosystem alike.

10. What is your proposed solution?
Our solution at Pictographs is a gamified Photo&Earn platform that integrates photography with blockchain technology. Users complete photo quests—capturing anything from cityscapes to quirky themes—earn rewards like NFTs and tokens, and engage in a community-driven ecosystem. We simplify Web3 entry with an intuitive interface, seamless wallet integration, and AI-powered verification to ensure authenticity. This turns a daily habit (photography) into a rewarding experience, giving creators a way to monetize their work while introducing millions to blockchain through a fun, accessible model. It’s creativity meets opportunity, powered by Web3.

11. Any competitions? (Does your project have direct competition or similar project on the market within or without apples ecosystem?)
Yes, Pictographs faces competition from platforms like GuruShots and SNPIT. Unlike these, we offer a unique Photo&Earn model with blockchain-backed rewards, NFT integration, and a community-driven approach, setting us apart within and beyond Apple’s ecosystem. Our AI-powered verification and seamless Web3 onboarding further differentiate us.

12. Why Aptos？
We chose Aptos for Pictographs because it’s a scalable, secure Layer-1 blockchain with fast transactions (150,000+ TPS), low fees, and the Move language for safe smart contracts—perfect for our NFT-driven Photo&Earn platform.
